##Enhancing Data Insights with SVM: A Simple Diabetes Dataset Classification Project

Machine Learning is not just about complex models; simplicity can also create meaningful insights. In this project, I explored a fundamental classification approach using the diabetes dataset from <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/1.5/datasets/toy_dataset.html">Scikit-learn</a>

I transformed the continuous target variable into binary classes to demonstrate how Support Vector Machines (SVM) can effectively classify data. Key features like BMI and blood pressure were chosen for simplicity and visualization.

The process involved data preparation, transformation, standardization, and model training. By visualizing the decision boundary, I ensured the model's predictions were easy to interpret.

This project underscores how even basic datasets can provide valuable insights with the right approach. It’s a testament to the power of focusing on clarity and purpose in machine learning.

I achieved 70-80% accuracy in distinguishing between high-risk and low-risk classes. The visualization of the decision boundary provides an intuitive understanding of the model’s performance.
